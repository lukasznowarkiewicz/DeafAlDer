# DeafAlDer

## Introduction

DeafAIDer system is a home signaling and alarm system designed specifically for people who are deaf. The idea was born as a project for the XLV Innovation and Invention Olympics at the Electrical and Electronic Schools in Szczecin, Poland, under the guidance of Dr. Dariusz Mostowski. Our goal was to create an affordable and scalable solution to alert deaf individuals to everyday events and emergencies through predefined light signals, vibrations, and low-frequency sound waves. It's user-friendly, integrates easily with existing home systems, and can work with both custom and commercial sensors.
